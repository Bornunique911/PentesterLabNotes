# Inroduction 00

* Just intro of how the flag would be and how to submit that.

# Inroduction 01

## The robots.txt file

* The `robots.txt` file is used to tell web spiders how to crawl a website. To avoid having confidential information indexed and searchable, webmasters often use this file to tell spiders to avoid specific pages. 

* This is done using the keyword `Disallow`.

* As an attacker, it's always a good idea to check the content of the `robots.txt` file and visit all the pages that are `disallowed` to find sensitive information.

## HTML comments

* HTML comments are often used to hide part of the application. For `security` reasons or just because a page or functionality has been removed from the website. 

* You can easily access the source code of a page using the `developer tools` in Chrome or Firefox. Then you can search for comments in the HTML code. Comments start with `<!--` and ends with `-->`.

* If you find a link, it's always worth visiting it.

## The thought process

* Here, you need to start using the functionality as it’s supposed to be used. This will give you an idea of what the code does.

* You can see that you provide an `IP address` and that the application is running the command `ping` with this IP address. It’s running a command. Let see if there is some way to abuse this functionality. By doing some research, you can find that there is a type of attack named `commands injection`.

## Commands injection

* Commands injection can be used to run arbitrary commands on a server. Multiple payloads can be used to trigger this behaviour. For example, let’s say that the initial command is:

* `ping [parameter]`

* Where `[parameter]` is the value you provided in the form or in the URL.

* If you look at how the command line works, you can find that there is multiple way to add more commands:

* `command1 && command2 that will run command2 if command1 succeeds.`
* `command1 || command2 that will run command2 if command1 fails.`
* `command1 ; command2 that will run command1 then command2.`
* `command1 | command2 that will run command1 and send the output of command1 to command2.`
* `...`

* In this application, we can provide a parameter to `command1`, but there is no `command2`. What we are going to do is add our own command. Instead of sending the `[parameter]` to the command:

* `ping 127.0.0.1`

* Where 127.0.0.1 is our `[parameter]`. We are going to send a `malicious [parameter]` that will contain another command:

* `ping 127.0.0.1 ; cat /etc/passwd`

* The application will think that `127.0.0.1 ; cat /etc/passwd` is just a parameter to run `command1`. But we actually injected `command2: cat /etc/passwd`.

* Now, what we want to do is run the command to score: `/usr/local/bin/score [uuid]`. We can just use the line above to run this command instead of `cat /etc/passwd`.
