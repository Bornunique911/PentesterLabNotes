# Essential: Open Redirect 01

* `Open Redirect` vulnerabilities allows you to `redirect` the victim to a malicious website. They are low impact vulnerabilities in most cases unless you can use them to leak `Oauth tokens`.

* In this challenge, you should be able to `redirect` the victim to a website you control (or `webhook.site`). Once the victim visit your page, you will get the key to score in the `User-Agent`. You can then submit the key.

* Here it's an trivial `openredirect,` you can just put any `URL` to get the victim to your website.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-ccfe6099-224a8324.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-ccfe6099-224a8324.libcurl.so/) .

* Here is how you do it.

# Essential: Open Redirect 02

* In this challenge, the redirect URL needs to start with `/`. The developer made the assumption that only a `path`/`URI` can start with `/`. However, it's possible to bypass this mechanism by using `//`. For this challenge, you may want to use another site than `webhook.site` as they don't automatically redirect `http://` to `https://`. Otherwise, you can use the `https://` URL for this exercise.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-e3a09ae0-27ea941f.libcurl.so/.](http://ptl-e3a09ae0-27ea941f.libcurl.so/.) You can also use the TLS version if you're experiencing timeouts due to network filtering: [https://ptl-e3a09ae0-27ea941f.libcurl.so/.](https://ptl-e3a09ae0-27ea941f.libcurl.so/.)

* `redirect.php?uri=/index.php` working good.
* `redirect.php?uri=https://google.com` not working good.

* Developer may restrict the url to starts with `/` but browser uderstands url `//www.google.com` as `same scheme` as original site and `URL` as specifed url(i.e, `www.google.com`.

* you can try this [http://ptl-e3a09ae0-27ea941f.libcurl.so/redirect.php?uri=//www.google.com](http://ptl-e3a09ae0-27ea941f.libcurl.so/redirect.php?uri=//www.google.com)
