# Solving JWT VII

* This exercise covers the exploitation of a website using JWT for session without verifying the signature

## Introduction

* This course details the exploitation of a weakness in the usage of JSON Web Token (JWT). In this application, JWT is used for authentication. Upon successful login, the user is issued a JWT in a cookie. This exercise is a very common covers a very common issue in application using JWT: not verifying the token's signature.

* If you want to do it by yourself, you can follow the following steps:

    * Create one user.
	    * Inspect the token (header and body).
		* Tamper with the token to gain admin access.

## Exploitation

* To exploit this issue, you just need to modify the payload of the JWT to change your username to `admin`. Since the application doesn't verify the signature, you can leave the signature as it's.

## Conclusion

* This exercise showed you another way to tamper with a JWT to gain administrator access in an application. It showed you that having a signature is only a security mechanism if it gets verified. Unfortunately, this issue is very common with modern web applications.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-e973b581-f7ea9f9e.libcurl.so/ 

* Just the replace `test` with `admin` in payload part of the jwt token and submit without changing any other fields.
