## Introduction

* This course details how to gain code execution when a Struts application is vulnerable to [s2-052](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-052). This vulnerability has already been widely exploited in the wild and is easily `worm-able`. Therefore, it's essential that you know how to test for it.

## Struts s2-052

* Struts `s2-052` impacts the following versions of Struts:

    * Struts 2.1.2 to 2.3.33 (inclusive)
    * Struts 2.5 to 2.5.12 (inclusive)

* The issue comes from a lack of filtering on the deserialization class used by the `REST` plugin. Struts uses `Xstream` with a lot of filtering for deserialization in multiple places, however this filtering was not in place for the REST plugin.

## The payload

* The payload has been packaged in a lot of tools already.

## Conclusion

* This exercise explained how to gain code execution when a Struts application is vulnerable to `s2-052`. When you are coming across a Struts application, it's essential that you test for this issue (as well as s2-045.
