# Essential : Directory Traversal 01

## Directory traversals

* Directory traversals come from a lack of filtering/encoding of information used as part of a path by an application.

* As with other vulnerabilities, you can use the `same value technique` to test for this type of issue. For example, if the path used by the application inside a parameter is `/images/photo.jpg`. You can try to access:

	* `/images/./photo.jpg`: you should see the same file.

	* `/images/../photo.jpg`: you should get an error.

	* `/images/../images/photo.jpg`: you should see the same file again.

	* `/images/../IMAGES/photo.jpg`: you should get an error (depending on the file system) or something weird is going on.

* If you don't have the value images and the legitimate path looks like `photo.jpg`, you will need to work out what the parent repository is.

* Once you have tested that, you can try to retrieve other files. On `Linux/Unix` the most common test case is the `/etc/passwd`. You can test: `images/../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, if you get the `passwd` file, the application is vulnerable. The good news is that you don't need to know the number of `../`. If you put too many, it will still work because at `root director`(`/`) if you use `cd ..` you will be at `root directory`(`/`) itself.

* Another interesting thing to know is that if you have a `directory traversal in Windows`, you will be able to access `test/../../../file.txt`, even if the directory test does not exist. This is not the case, on `Linux`. This can be really useful where the code concatenates user-controlled data, to create a file name. 

* For example, the following `PHP` code is supposed to add the parameter `id` to get a `file name` (`example_1.txt` for example). On `Linux`, you won't be able to exploit this vulnerability if there is no directory starting by `example_`, whereas on `Windows`, you will be able to exploit it, even if there is no such directory.

* `$file = "/var/files/example_".$_GET['id'].".txt"`;

* In these exercises, the vulnerabilities are illustrated by a script used inside an `<img` tag. You will need to read the `HTML` source (or use `Copy image URL`) to find the correct link, and start exploiting the issue.

* The first example is a really simple `directory traversal`. You just need to go up in the file system, and then back down, to get any files you want. In this instance, you will be restricted by the file system permissions, and won't be able to access `/etc/shadow`, for example.

* In this example, based on the `header` sent by the server, your browser will display the content of the response. Sometimes the server will send the response with a header `Content-Disposition: attachment`, and your browser will not display the file directly. You can open the file to see the content. This method will take you some time for every test.

* Using a `Linux/Unix` system, you can do this more quickly, by using `wget` or `curl`.

$path = $UploadDir . $file;

# Essential : Directory Traversal 02

* In this example, you can see that the full path is used to access the file. However, if you try to just replace it with `/etc/passwd`, you won't get anything. It looks like a simple check is performed by the `PHP` code. You can however bypass it by keeping the beginning of the path and add your payload at the end, to go up and back down within the file system.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-5f87f7f6-1c9ae78f.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-5f87f7f6-1c9ae78f.libcurl.so/).


* `http://ptl-5f87f7f6-1c9ae78f.libcurl.so/file.php?file=/var/www/./file.php` and view the source code.

* This is the restriction that was implemented.
```php
if (!(strstr($file,"/var/www/")))
	die();
```

# Essential : Directory Traversal 03

* This example is based on a common problem when you exploit directory traversal: the `server-side code adds its own suffix to your payload`. This can be easily bypassed, by using a `NULL BYTE` (which you need to `URL-encode` as `%00`). Using `NULL BYTE` to get rid of any suffix added by the server-side code is a common bypass, and works really well in `Perl` and `older versions` of `PHP`.

* In this code, the issue is simulated since `PHP` solved this type of bypass since the `version 5.3.41`.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-3671739f-159f3465.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-3671739f-159f3465.libcurl.so/).

* `http://ptl-3671739f-159f3465.libcurl.so/file.php?file=./file.php%00`

```php
$UploadDir = '/var/www/';
$file = $_GET['file'];
$path = $UploadDir . $file.".png";
// Simulate null-byte issue that used to be in filesystem related functions in PHP
$path = preg_replace('/\x00.*/',"",$path);
$handle = fopen($path, 'rb')
do {
	$data = fread($handle, 8192);
	if (strlen($data) == 0) {
		break;
	}
	echo($data);
} while (true);
fclose($handle);
exit();
