* In this first example, you connect to a `LDAP server`, using your username and password. In this instance, The `LDAP` server does not authenticate you, since your credentials are invalid.

* However, some `LDAP` servers authorise `NULL` `Bind:` if `null` values are sent, the `LDAP` server will proceed to `bind` the connection, and the `PHP` code will think that the credentials are correct. To get the bind with `2 null` values, you will need to completely remove this parameter from the query. If you keep something like `username=&password=` in the `URL,` these values will not work, since they won't be null; instead, they will be empty.

* `This is an important check to perform on all login forms that you will test in the future, even if the backend is not LDAP-based`.

* you can intercept with `burp` and remove `username=tej&password=tej` from body.

* or with developer tools, `select` post request and `right click` and hover over `copy` then `click` on `copy as cURL` option then the request will be copied as follows.

* `curl "http://ptl-494abacc-475b2c89.libcurl.so/" -H "Connection: keep-alive" -H "Cache-Control: max-age=0" -H "Origin: http://ptl-494abacc-475b2c89.libcurl.so" -H "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.87 Safari/537.36" -H "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3" -H "Referer: http://ptl-494abacc-475b2c89.libcurl.so/" -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" -H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9" --data "username=te&password=te" --compressed --insecure`

* From copied request change `--data "username=te&password=te"` to `--data ""`

* The most common pattern of `LDAP injection` is to be able to inject in a `filter.` Here, we will see how you can use `LDAP injection` to bypass an `authentication` check.

* First, you need to learn a bit of `LDAP` syntax. When you are retrieving a `user,` based on its `username,` the following will be used:

	* `(cn=[INPUT])`

* If you want to add more conditions and some boolean logic, you can use:

	* A boolean `OR` using `|`: `(|(cn=[INPUT1])(cn=[INPUT2]))` to get records matching `[INPUT1]` or `[INPUT2]`.

	* A boolean `AND` using `&`: `(&(cn=[INPUT1])(userPassword=[INPUT2]))` to get records for which the cn matches `[INPUT1]` and the password matches `[INPUT2].`

	* As you can see, the boolean logic is located at the beginning of the filter. Since you're likely to inject after it, it's not always possible (depending on the `LDAP` server) to inject logic inside the filter, if it's just `(cn=[INPUT])`.

* `LDAP` uses the `wildcard` `*` character very often, to match any values. This can be used for match everything `*` or just `substrings` (for example, `adm*` for all words starting with `adm).`

* As with other injections, we will need to remove anything added by the `server-side` code. We can get rid of the end of the filter, using a `NULL BYTE` (encoded as `%00`).

* Here, we have a login script. We can see that if we use:

	* `username=hacker&password=hacker` we get authenticated (this is the `normal` request).

	* `username=hack*&password=hacker` we get authenticated (the `wildcard` matches the same value).
	
	* `username=hacker&password=hac*` we don't get authenticated (the password may likely be `hashed).`

* Now, we will see how we can use the `LDAP injection`, in the `username` parameter to bypass the authentication. Based on our previous tests, we can deduce that the filter probably looks like:

	* `(&(cn=[INPUT1])(userPassword=HASH[INPUT2]))`

	* Where `HASH` is an `unsalted hash` (probably `MD5` or `SHA1).`

* `LDAP` supports several formats: ``` `{CLEARTEXT}` ```, ``` `{MD5}` ```, ``` `{SMD5}` ``` (salted `MD5` ), ``` `{SHA}` ```, ``` `{SSHA}` ``` (salted `SHA1),` ``` `{CRYPT}` ``` for storing passwords.

* Since `[INPUT2]` is `hashed,` we cannot use it to inject our payload.

* Our goal here will be to inject inside `[INPUT1]` (the `username` parameter). We will need to inject:

	* The end of the current filter using `hacker)`.
	
	* An always-true condition ( `(cn=*)` for example)

	* A `)` to keep a valid syntax and close the first `(`.

	* A `NULL BYTE` `(%00)` to get rid of the end of the filter.

* Once you put this together, you should be able to login as `hacker` with any `password.` You can then try to find other users using the `wildcard` trick. For example, you can use `a*` in the first part of the filter, and check who you are logged in as.

* In most cases, `LDAP injection` will allow only you to bypass `authentication` and `authorisation` checks. Retrieving arbitrary data (as opposed to just getting more results) is often really challenging or impossible.
