# JWT VI

* This exercise covers the exploitation of an injection in the kid element of a JWT. This injection can be used to bypass the signature mechanism

## Introduction

* This course details the exploitation of a weakness in the usage of JSON Web Token (JWT). In this application, JWT is used for authentication. Upon successful login, the user is issued a JWT in a cookie. This exercise was inspired by one of the challenges during `BitcoinCTF`: one of the best and most complex web Capture-The-Flag.

* If you want to do it by yourself, you can follow the following steps:

    * Create one user.
    * Inspect the token (header and body).
    * Use the script you created for JWT II
    * Tamper with the token to gain admin access.

## The vulnerability

* This issue comes from one of the fields in the header: `kid`. This parameter is available in some libraries, it's short for key identifier. In this application, the kid is used without proper escaping to retrieve the key. This lack of escaping could lead to multiple types of vulnerabilities:

    * SQL injections.
    * Directory traversals.
    * ...

## Exploitation

* First, you will need to automate the testing and see what happens when you tamper with the kid value.

* After poking for a bit, you should be able to discover what type of vulnerabilities is present in the retrieval of the key. 

* Using this, you will need to find an injection that will return a predictable result. Once you have this injection you will be able to sign your malicious JWT.

* A good way to get a predictable result is to get rid of the first raw of the result using a random string then adding a predictable row using `UNION SELECT '1 `

## Conclusion

* This exercise showed you another way to tamper with a JWT to gain administrator access in an application. It showed you that having a signed value is only as strong as the way the signature is handled. Here by finding a vulnerability in the way the key was retrieved, you were able to use a weak key and bypass the signature.
